Practice using Ceres::Solver.

### denoising
This is from example provided by ceres. It takes in a pgm image and a field of expert to denoise the image.

### diffusion
This is my implementation of diffusion process (inhomogeneous and anisotropic diffusion). 

### completion
This is a simple image-guided depth completion method based on the assumption that depth is continuous unless there is an edge in the image.
